  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why are Dachshunds prone to back problems?",
      "answer": "Their elongated spine and short legs put tremendous stress on intervertebral discs. About 1 in 4 Dachshunds will experience IVDD in their lifetime, making back surgery coverage essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Dachshund?",
      "answer": "Highly recommended. IVDD surgery costs $4,000-$10,000, and many Dachshunds need it. Given the high likelihood of back issues, insurance typically pays for itself with this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does insurance cover IVDD surgery?",
      "answer": "Most comprehensive policies cover IVDD as long as it's not pre-existing. Check orthopedic waiting periods—some insurers require 12 months before covering spinal issues. Embrace only requires 6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I reduce my Dachshund's back problems?",
      "answer": "Keep them at a healthy weight (crucial!), use ramps instead of stairs, prevent jumping on/off furniture, and support their back when carrying them. Even with precautions, insurance is still recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get dental coverage for my Dachshund?",
      "answer": "Dental illness coverage can be valuable for Dachshunds since their small mouths are prone to crowding and decay. Embrace and Pumpkin include dental illness coverage in their standard plans."
