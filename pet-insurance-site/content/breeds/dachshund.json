  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why are Dachshunds prone to back problems?",
      "answer": "Their elongated spine and short legs put tremendous stress on their intervertebral discs. About 1 in 4 Dachshunds will experience some form of IVDD in their lifetime, making back surgery coverage essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Dachshund?",
      "answer": "Highly recommended. IVDD surgery alone can cost $4,000-$10,000, and many Dachshunds need it. Given the high likelihood of back issues, insurance typically pays for itself quickly with this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does insurance cover IVDD surgery?",
      "answer": "Most comprehensive policies cover IVDD surgery as long as it's not pre-existing. Check for orthopedic waiting periods—some insurers require 12 months before covering spinal issues. Embrace only requires 6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I reduce my Dachshund's back problems?",
      "answer": "Keep them at a healthy weight (crucial!), use ramps instead of stairs, prevent jumping on/off furniture, and support their back when carrying them. Even with precautions, insurance is still recommended due to genetic factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get dental coverage for my Dachshund?",
      "answer": "Dental illness coverage (different from routine cleaning) can be valuable for Dachshunds since their small mouths are prone to crowding and decay. Embrace and Pumpkin include dental illness coverage in their standard plans."
