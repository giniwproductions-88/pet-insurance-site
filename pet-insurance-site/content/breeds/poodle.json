  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is bloat and why are Poodles at risk?",
      "answer": "Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) is when the stomach twists, cutting off blood flow. It's fatal without emergency surgery. Standard Poodles are at high risk due to their deep chests. Surgery costs $2,500-$7,500+."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Addison's disease?",
      "answer": "Addison's disease is an adrenal gland disorder where the body doesn't produce enough hormones. Poodles have a genetic predisposition. It requires lifelong medication ($50-200/month) but is manageable with proper treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Poodle?",
      "answer": "Yes. While Poodles are healthier than many purebreds, bloat alone can cost $7,500+ for emergency surgery. Addison's disease adds ongoing medication costs. Insurance provides important financial protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Miniature and Toy Poodles have the same health issues?",
      "answer": "Smaller Poodles have lower bloat risk but higher risk for dental problems and luxating patella (knee issues). All sizes share risks for Addison's disease and eye problems."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I insure my Poodle?",
      "answer": "Insure as a puppy before any conditions develop. Addison's disease typically appears between ages 2-6, so having coverage in place early is important. Most insurers have waiting periods of 2-14 days."
