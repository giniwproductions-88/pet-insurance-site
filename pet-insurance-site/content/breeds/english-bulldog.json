  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is English Bulldog insurance so expensive?",
      "answer": "English Bulldogs have more health issues than almost any other breed. Their flat faces cause breathing problems, their body structure leads to joint issues, and their skin folds cause chronic infections. Insurers know they'll likely pay out claims, so premiums reflect that risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for an English Bulldog?",
      "answer": "Absolutely yes. The question isn't if your Bulldog will need expensive care, but when. BOAS surgery alone can cost $5,000+, and most Bulldogs need some medical intervention. Insurance typically pays for itself within 1-2 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure my English Bulldog?",
      "answer": "As young as possible, ideally 8-12 weeks when you get them. This ensures no pre-existing conditions are documented and waiting periods are finished before issues typically emerge around age 2-4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will insurance cover my Bulldog's breathing surgery?",
      "answer": "Most comprehensive policies cover BOAS surgery as long as it wasn't a pre-existing condition. Get insurance before any vet documents breathing concerns. Embrace, Healthy Paws, and Trupanion all cover this."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any companies that won't insure English Bulldogs?",
      "answer": "Most major pet insurers will cover Bulldogs, but some may have breed-specific exclusions or waiting periods. Always confirm coverage details before purchasing. Avoid any policy that excludes brachycephalic conditions."
