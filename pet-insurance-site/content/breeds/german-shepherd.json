      "question": "Should I get insurance for a German Shepherd puppy?",

      "question": "What's the orthopedic waiting period for German Shepherds?",
      "answer": "Most insurers require 6-14 months before covering orthopedic conditions like hip dysplasia. Embrace offers the shortest at 6 months. Enroll early to clear this window."
