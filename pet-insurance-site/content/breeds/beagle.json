  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Are Beagles expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Beagles are moderately priced to insure—typically $35-65/month. They're healthier than many breeds, but their tendency to eat foreign objects means emergency coverage is important."
    },
    {
      "question": "What health problems are Beagles prone to?",
      "answer": "Beagles commonly face epilepsy, hypothyroidism, cherry eye, ear infections, and disc disease. They're also notorious for eating things they shouldn't, leading to emergency surgeries for foreign body removal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Beagle?",
      "answer": "Yes, especially because Beagles often eat foreign objects requiring expensive surgery. They can also develop chronic conditions like epilepsy that require lifelong medication. Insurance helps manage these costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Beagle?",
      "answer": "Wellness coverage can be worthwhile for Beagles since they need regular ear cleanings and are prone to obesity. However, run the numbers—wellness plans sometimes cost more than they return."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Beagles have a lot of health issues?",
      "answer": "Beagles are moderately healthy compared to many purebreds. They don't have the severe issues of flat-faced or giant breeds, but they're not problem-free. Ear infections, eye issues, and seizures are the most common concerns."
