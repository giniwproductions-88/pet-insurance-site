    {
      "question": "Why do Huskies have so many eye problems?",
      "answer": "Huskies are genetically predisposed to several eye conditions including juvenile cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, and corneal dystrophy. Responsible breeders test for these, but they're still common. Get insurance with eye coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Husky?",
      "answer": "Yes. While Huskies are healthier than many breeds, eye surgeries are expensive ($5,000+ for cataracts) and their adventurous nature leads to accidents. Insurance provides important financial protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Huskies have a lot of health problems?",
      "answer": "Huskies are relatively healthy compared to many purebreds. Their main concerns are eye conditions and some autoimmune issues. They're generally hardier than flat-faced or giant breeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about accidents with a Husky?",
      "answer": "Yes—Huskies are notorious escape artists and runners. They're more likely than some breeds to be hit by cars, get into fights, or injure themselves exploring. Accident coverage is important."
    },
    {
      "question": "What autoimmune disorders affect Huskies?",
      "answer": "Huskies can develop lupus, zinc-responsive dermatosis, and uveodermatologic syndrome. These require ongoing treatment and medication. Look for insurance that covers chronic conditions."
