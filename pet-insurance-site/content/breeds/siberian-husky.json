      "question": "Why do Huskies have so many eye problems?",
      "answer": "Huskies are genetically predisposed to several eye conditions including juvenile cataracts, PRA, and corneal dystrophy. Responsible breeders test for these, but they're still common. Get insurance with eye coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Husky?",
      "answer": "Yes. While Huskies are healthier than many breeds, eye surgeries are expensive ($5,000+ for cataracts) and their adventurous nature leads to accidents. Insurance provides important financial protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Huskies have a lot of health problems?",
      "answer": "Huskies are relatively healthy compared to many purebreds. Their main concerns are eye conditions and some autoimmune issues. They're generally hardier than flat-faced or giant breeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about accidents with a Husky?",
      "answer": "Yes—Huskies are notorious escape artists and runners. They're more likely than some breeds to get hit by cars, get into fights, or injure themselves exploring. Accident coverage is important."
    },
    {
      "question": "What autoimmune disorders affect Huskies?",
      "answer": "Huskies can develop lupus, zinc-responsive dermatosis, and uveodermatologic syndrome. These require ongoing treatment. Look for insurance that covers chronic conditions well."
