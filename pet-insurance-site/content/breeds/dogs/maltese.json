    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Maltese?",
      "answer": "Yes. Maltese commonly need dental extractions, knee surgery, and some have liver shunts. Their fragile size also means injury risk. Insurance helps manage these predictable expenses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Maltese have such bad teeth?",
      "answer": "Tiny mouths mean crowded teeth that trap bacteria. Most Maltese need professional dental cleanings annually and many require extractions. Dental insurance coverage is valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a portosystemic shunt?",
      "answer": "An abnormal blood vessel bypasses the liver, allowing toxins to circulate. Symptoms include stunted growth, seizures, and behavioral issues. Surgery can correct it but costs $2,000-6,000+."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is White Dog Shaker Syndrome?",
      "answer": "A tremor disorder affecting small white dogs including Maltese. Dogs shake uncontrollably, especially when stressed. It's treatable with medication but not curable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Maltese fragile?",
      "answer": "Yes—their tiny bones break easily from falls or rough handling. They're also prone to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Good accident coverage is important."
