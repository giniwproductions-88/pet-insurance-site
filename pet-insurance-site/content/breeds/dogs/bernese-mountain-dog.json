      "answer": "Cancer, particularly histiocytic sarcoma, affects Berners at alarming rates. Nearly 50% die from cancer, often before age 8. This genetic predisposition significantly shortens their lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Bernese Mountain Dog?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. With cancer rates near 50% and high orthopedic issues, most Berners will face major medical expenses. A single cancer treatment can exceed $15,000. Insurance is mandatory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What annual limit do I need?",
      "answer": "We recommend unlimited coverage. Cancer treatment plus joint surgery could easily exceed $20,000 in a single year. Policies with $10,000 limits are inadequate for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I insure my Berner?",
      "answer": "Immediately as a puppy. Joint issues can develop during rapid growth (4-12 months), and cancer can strike at any age. Early insurance ensures maximum coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I consider preventive gastropexy?",
      "answer": "Yes, strongly consider stomach tacking during spay/neuter surgery. It prevents life-threatening bloat and costs $200-500 when combined with another procedure. Some insurance covers this."
