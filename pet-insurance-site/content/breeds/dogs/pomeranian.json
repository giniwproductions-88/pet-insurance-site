    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Pomeranians have dental problems?",
      "answer": "Tiny mouths mean crowded teeth. Most Poms need regular dental cleanings and many require extractions. Good dental coverage is valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Pomeranians fragile?",
      "answer": "Yes—small bones break easily from falls or rough play. They're also prone to hypoglycemia. Careful handling and good accident coverage are important."
