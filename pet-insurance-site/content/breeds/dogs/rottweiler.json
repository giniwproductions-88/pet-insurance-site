      "answer": "Most pet insurance companies cover Rottweilers for health insurance. However, some homeowner's policies have breed restrictions. For pet insurance specifically, Healthy Paws, Embrace, and Trupanion all cover Rottweilers without issue."

    {
      "question": "Why is cancer coverage important for Rottweilers?",
      "answer": "Rottweilers have one of the highest cancer rates of any breed, particularly bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Treatment can easily exceed $10,000, making comprehensive cancer coverage essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure a Rottweiler?",
      "answer": "Insure as a puppy, ideally around 8-12 weeks. Cancer and joint issues often develop in middle age (5-8 years), so having coverage established early ensures these won't be considered pre-existing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get coverage for hip dysplasia?",
      "answer": "Yes, orthopedic coverage is crucial for Rottweilers. Hip dysplasia surgery can cost $7,000+. Be aware of waiting periods—some insurers require 12 months before covering hip issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Rottweiler?",
      "answer": "Yes. Given their elevated cancer risk and likelihood of orthopedic issues, most Rottweiler owners will face at least one major medical expense. Insurance provides peace of mind and makes expensive treatments accessible."
