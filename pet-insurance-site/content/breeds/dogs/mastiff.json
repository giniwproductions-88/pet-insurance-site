      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Mastiff?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. Giant breeds face expensive conditions like bloat, hip dysplasia, and cancer. A single bloat surgery can cost $7,000+. Insurance is non-negotiable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Mastiff insurance expensive?",
      "answer": "Giant breeds cost more to treat—larger drug doses, bigger surgical equipment, more anesthesia. Combined with high-risk conditions, premiums reflect the reality of giant breed care."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Mastiffs live?",
      "answer": "Typically 6-10 years, shorter than smaller breeds. This makes quality of life during those years critical. Insurance helps ensure you can afford the best care."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get a preventive gastropexy?",
      "answer": "Many vets recommend gastropexy (stomach tacking) during spay/neuter to prevent bloat. It costs $200-400 when done with another surgery and can be lifesaving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Mastiffs prone to cancer?",
      "answer": "Yes—osteosarcoma (bone cancer) is more common in giant breeds. It's aggressive and expensive to treat. Unlimited coverage is valuable for potential cancer treatment."
