    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for an Australian Cattle Dog?",
      "answer": "Yes. ACDs are prone to hip dysplasia, hereditary eye conditions, and deafness. Their active nature also increases injury risk. Insurance helps cover both genetic conditions and accidents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Australian Cattle Dogs prone to deafness?",
      "answer": "Yes—hereditary deafness linked to their coat color genetics affects some ACDs. BAER testing can identify deaf or partially deaf puppies. It doesn't require treatment but affects training approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "What eye problems do Heelers get?",
      "answer": "Progressive Retinal Atrophy (causes gradual blindness) and lens luxation (eye emergency) both occur in the breed. Regular eye exams and genetic testing help identify at-risk dogs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Australian Cattle Dogs get injured often?",
      "answer": "Their intense drive and fearlessness can lead to injuries during work or play. They'll push through pain, so owners may not notice problems immediately. Good accident coverage is valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Australian Cattle Dogs live?",
      "answer": "12-16 years typically—one of the longer-lived breeds. The famous Bluey lived to 29! Their longevity makes insurance a good long-term investment."
