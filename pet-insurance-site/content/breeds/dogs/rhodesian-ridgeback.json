    { "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Rhodesian Ridgeback?", "answer": "Yes. Ridgebacks face dermoid sinus, hip dysplasia, and bloat. Insurance helps cover both breed-specific conditions and common large breed issues." },
    { "question": "What is dermoid sinus?", "answer": "A tube-like defect along the spine that the ridge is formed from. It's hereditary and can become infected if not surgically removed. Reputable breeders screen puppies." },
    { "question": "Are Ridgebacks prone to bloat?", "answer": "Yes—their deep chest puts them at risk. Preventive gastropexy is often recommended. Know the symptoms and have an emergency plan." },
    { "question": "What causes the ridge?", "answer": "A genetic mutation causing hair to grow in the opposite direction. The same genetics unfortunately can cause dermoid sinus." },
    { "question": "How long do Rhodesian Ridgebacks live?", "answer": "10-12 years typically. Proper screening and health management helps maximize lifespan." }
