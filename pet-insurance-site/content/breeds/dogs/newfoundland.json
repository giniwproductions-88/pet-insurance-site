    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Newfoundland?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's essential. Newfies are prone to heart disease (SAS), hip dysplasia, and bloat—all expensive conditions. Their giant size means higher costs for everything. Insurance protects you from major financial surprises."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is subaortic stenosis (SAS)?",
      "answer": "SAS is a heart defect where tissue below the aortic valve obstructs blood flow. It's hereditary and common in Newfoundlands. Mild cases may need monitoring; severe cases require medication or surgery. Screening is recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are Newfoundlands expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Giant breeds cost more because treatment costs more—larger drug doses, bigger equipment, more anesthesia. Combined with their predisposition to expensive conditions, insurance companies price accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I screen my Newfoundland for heart disease?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Cardiac screening (echocardiogram) is recommended for all Newfoundlands, especially before breeding. Early detection allows for management before symptoms appear. Reputable breeders screen their dogs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Newfoundlands live?",
      "answer": "Typically 8-10 years. Their shorter lifespan makes quality of life during those years even more important. Insurance helps ensure you can afford the best care without financial constraints."
