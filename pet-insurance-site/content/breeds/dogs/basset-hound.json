    { "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Basset Hound?", "answer": "Yes. Bassets face chronic ear infections, back problems, and bloat risk. Insurance helps manage these predictable ongoing costs." },
    { "question": "Why do Basset Hounds get ear infections?", "answer": "Their long, heavy ears trap moisture and limit airflow. Weekly cleaning helps but many Bassets still need regular veterinary ear treatment." },

    { "question": "Are Bassets prone to bloat?", "answer": "Yes—their deep chest puts them at risk. Feed smaller meals, avoid exercise after eating, and know the symptoms." },
    { "question": "How long do Basset Hounds live?", "answer": "10-12 years typically. Managing weight is crucial—obese Bassets have more health problems and shorter lives." }
