    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for Labrador Retrievers?",
      "answer": "Yes. Labs are active dogs prone to joint injuries, ACL tears, and swallowing foreign objects. A single knee surgery costs $3,000-5,000. Insurance provides peace of mind for a breed that lives life at full speed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does pet insurance cover ACL/CCL tears in Labs?",
      "answer": "Yes. Cruciate ligament tears are covered as injuries or hereditary conditions, depending on the insurer. Note: if one knee tears, the other often follows—make sure your policy covers bilateral conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "My Lab ate a sock. Will insurance cover surgery?",
      "answer": "Yes. Foreign object ingestion is covered by most accident-and-illness policies. This is one of the most common claims for Labs—another reason insurance makes sense for the breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure a Labrador Retriever?",
      "answer": "As a puppy, ideally 8-12 weeks. Premiums are lowest, nothing is pre-existing, and you'll clear orthopedic waiting periods before joint issues typically appear (around age 2-4)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Labrador Retrievers expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Moderate. Labs cost less than high-risk breeds like French Bulldogs or German Shepherds but more than smaller, healthier breeds. Expect $40-75/month for adult coverage."
