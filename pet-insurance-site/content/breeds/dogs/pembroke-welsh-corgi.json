  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Corgi?",
      "answer": "Yes. Corgis are prone to IVDD (back surgery costs $5,000-8,000) and hip dysplasia. Their long-backed build makes spinal issues likely. Insurance helps manage these significant costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is IVDD in Corgis?",
      "answer": "Intervertebral Disc Disease occurs when spinal discs degenerate or herniate, causing pain, weakness, or paralysis. Corgis are at high risk due to their body shape. Treatment ranges from rest to emergency surgery."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I limit my Corgi's jumping?",
      "answer": "Yes. Jumping on/off furniture stresses their spine and can trigger IVDD. Use ramps, keep them at healthy weight, and avoid activities that strain their back. This helps but doesn't eliminate risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is degenerative myelopathy?",
      "answer": "DM is a progressive disease affecting the spinal cord, causing hind leg weakness and eventual paralysis. There's no cure, but physical therapy helps maintain quality of life. Genetic testing can identify carriers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Corgis have weight problems?",
      "answer": "Yes—they love food and gain weight easily. Extra weight stresses their back and joints, increasing IVDD and dysplasia risk. Keeping your Corgi lean is one of the best things you can do for their health."
