  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a St. Bernard?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. St. Bernards are expensive to care for—larger drug doses, bigger equipment, and high rates of hip dysplasia, bloat, and heart disease. A single bloat surgery can cost $7,000+. Insurance is essential for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is St. Bernard insurance so expensive?",
      "answer": "Giant breeds cost more to insure because everything costs more to treat. More anesthesia, larger implants, higher drug doses. Add their predisposition to expensive conditions like bloat and hip dysplasia, and premiums reflect the risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is bloat and why is it dangerous?",
      "answer": "Bloat (GDV) occurs when the stomach fills with gas and twists. It's a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate surgery. Deep-chested breeds like St. Bernards are at high risk. Surgery costs $3,000-7,500+."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do St. Bernards live?",
      "answer": "Typically 8-10 years, shorter than smaller breeds. This makes insurance valuable for the years you have—you want to maximize quality of life without financial stress."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get preventive care coverage for my St. Bernard?",
      "answer": "Consider it. Regular joint supplements, cardiac screening, and weight management are important for this breed. Some wellness plans help offset these routine costs."
