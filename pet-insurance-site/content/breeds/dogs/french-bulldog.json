    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for French Bulldogs?",
      "answer": "Yes. Frenchies are among the most expensive breeds to own due to breathing, spine, and skin issues. A single surgery can cost $3,000-8,000. Insurance typically pays for itself with one major claim."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does pet insurance cover BOAS surgery?",
      "answer": "Most comprehensive policies cover BOAS surgery as long as symptoms weren't present before enrollment. Embrace, Pumpkin, and Healthy Paws all cover it under hereditary conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure a French Bulldog?",
      "answer": "As young as possible—ideally 8-12 weeks. Premiums are lowest, and no conditions are 'pre-existing' yet. Many Frenchie health issues show up by age 2-3."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are French Bulldog allergies covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Yes, allergies are typically covered as a chronic illness. However, if your Frenchie showed allergy symptoms before enrollment, it may be excluded as pre-existing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are French Bulldogs so expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Their brachycephalic (flat-faced) structure causes breathing problems, and their compact spine leads to disc issues. Insurers price based on breed health data, and Frenchies file more claims than average."
