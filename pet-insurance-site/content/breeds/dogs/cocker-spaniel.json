      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Cocker Spaniel?",
      "answer": "Yes. Cockers have chronic ear infections, multiple eye conditions, and hip dysplasia. These ongoing issues add up over time. Insurance helps manage both recurring costs and major procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Cocker Spaniels get so many ear infections?",
      "answer": "Their long, floppy ears trap moisture and limit airflow, creating perfect conditions for bacteria and yeast. Regular cleaning helps, but many Cockers need ongoing veterinary treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What eye problems do Cockers get?",
      "answer": "Progressive Retinal Atrophy (gradual blindness), cataracts, cherry eye, and glaucoma all occur in the breed. Regular eye exams can catch issues early. Surgery may be needed for cataracts or cherry eye."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are American and English Cocker Spaniels different?",
      "answer": "Yes—they're separate breeds with similar health concerns. American Cockers are smaller with rounder heads. Both face ear, eye, and hip issues. Insurance recommendations apply to both."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I clean my Cocker's ears?",
      "answer": "Weekly cleaning is typically recommended. Use a vet-approved ear cleaner and dry thoroughly. Even with good care, some Cockers still develop infections due to ear structure."
