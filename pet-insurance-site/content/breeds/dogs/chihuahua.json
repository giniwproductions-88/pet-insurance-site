      "question": "Are Chihuahuas expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "No, Chihuahuas are among the cheapest breeds to insure—typically $25-50/month. Their small size means lower surgery costs, though dental and heart issues can still be expensive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Chihuahuas have dental problems?",
      "answer": "Their tiny jaws can't accommodate all their teeth properly, leading to severe crowding, decay, and gum disease. Many Chihuahuas need teeth extracted. Look for insurance covering dental illness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Chihuahua?",
      "answer": "Yes. Despite low premiums, Chihuahuas commonly need knee surgery ($3,000+), heart treatment, and dental work. Their long lifespan (14-18 years) means more opportunity for issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is luxating patella?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do Chihuahuas have heart problems?",
      "answer": "Yes, Chihuahuas are prone to mitral valve disease, a progressive heart condition. It's manageable with medication but can require expensive treatment. Insurance with heart coverage is important."
