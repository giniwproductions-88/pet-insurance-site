    },
    {
      "question": "Does pet insurance cover cancer in Golden Retrievers?",
      "answer": "Yes. All major insurers cover cancer treatment including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and medications—as long as it develops after enrollment. This is the #1 reason to insure a Golden."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will pet insurance cover hip dysplasia?",
      "answer": "Yes, but most policies have a 6-12 month waiting period for orthopedic conditions. Enroll early before any symptoms appear to ensure coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure a Golden Retriever?",
      "answer": "As early as possible—8-12 weeks is ideal. Premiums are lowest, and crucially, no conditions are pre-existing. Hip issues often show up by age 2, and cancer risk increases after age 6."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Golden Retrievers get cancer so often?",
      "answer": "Genetics. The breed's limited gene pool has concentrated cancer-causing mutations. Research through the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study is working to understand and reduce this, but for now, insurance is the best protection."
