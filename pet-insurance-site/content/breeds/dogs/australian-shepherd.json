    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Aussie?",
      "answer": "Optional. Active Aussies may benefit from wellness plans covering routine care and annual eye exams. However, compare costs—paying out of pocket sometimes saves money."

    {
      "question": "Are sports injuries covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Yes, most pet insurance covers accidents including sports injuries from agility, frisbee, or herding. Aussies are athletic, making accident coverage particularly valuable."
