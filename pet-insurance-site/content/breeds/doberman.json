  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Dobermans have such high heart disease rates?",
      "answer": "Dobermans have a genetic predisposition to Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). Studies suggest 50-60% of Dobermans will develop this condition. Annual cardiac screening and comprehensive insurance are essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Doberman?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. With over half of Dobermans developing DCM, which requires expensive ongoing treatment, insurance is not optional for this breed. A single year of cardiac treatment can exceed $10,000."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is von Willebrand's Disease?",
      "answer": "A bleeding disorder common in Dobermans that affects blood clotting. While manageable, it complicates any surgery and requires special precautions. Test your Doberman before any procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get regular heart screenings?",
      "answer": "Yes, annual echocardiograms are recommended for Dobermans starting at age 2-3. Early detection of DCM allows for treatment that can extend life. Some insurance covers these diagnostic tests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do insurance companies restrict Doberman coverage?",
      "answer": "Most major pet insurers cover Dobermans for health insurance. However, some homeowner's policies have breed restrictions. Check both types of insurance when adding a Doberman to your family."
