  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Shih Tzus have so many eye problems?",
      "answer": "Shih Tzus have shallow eye sockets causing their eyes to bulge, making them vulnerable to scratches, ulcers, and proptosis (eye popping out). Eye injuries are common and often require veterinary care."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Shih Tzu?",
      "answer": "Yes. Between eye issues, potential breathing problems, and dental disease, Shih Tzus often need veterinary care. Insurance helps manage costs for this affectionate but health-prone breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Shih Tzus have breathing problems like Bulldogs?",
      "answer": "Shih Tzus are brachycephalic (flat-faced) and can have breathing issues, though typically less severe than Bulldogs. Some may need surgery to correct elongated soft palates or narrow nostrils."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get dental coverage for my Shih Tzu?",
      "answer": "Yes, dental coverage is valuable for Shih Tzus. Their small mouths lead to crowded teeth and decay. Look for policies that cover dental illness (infections, extractions), not just dental accidents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Shih Tzus expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Shih Tzus have moderate insurance costs, typically $35-60/month. They're less expensive than large breeds or breeds with severe health issues, but still require comprehensive coverage."
