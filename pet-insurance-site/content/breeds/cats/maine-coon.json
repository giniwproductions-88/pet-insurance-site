    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Maine Coon?",
      "answer": "Yes. Maine Coons are prone to HCM (heart disease) and hip dysplasia—both expensive to treat. HCM alone can cost $1,000-2,000+ annually in medication and monitoring. Insurance provides peace of mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is HCM in Maine Coons?",
      "answer": "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder to pump blood. It's the most common heart disease in cats and particularly prevalent in Maine Coons. Regular screening and early treatment improve outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Maine Coons really get hip dysplasia?",
      "answer": "Yes—unusual for cats but Maine Coons are an exception due to their large size. Studies show up to 18% of Maine Coons have some degree of hip dysplasia. It's worth getting orthopedic coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I screen my Maine Coon for genetic conditions?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Reputable breeders screen for HCM and other conditions. Even with clear screenings, regular heart checkups are recommended. Insurance helps cover these diagnostics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Maine Coons expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Slightly higher than average domestic cats but not extreme. Expect $28-55/month for good coverage. Given their predisposition to costly conditions, it's a reasonable investment."
