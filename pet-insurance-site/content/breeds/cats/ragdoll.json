      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Ragdoll cat?",
      "answer": "Yes. Ragdolls are prone to HCM and bladder stones—both can result in thousands in vet bills. Their gentle nature means they're indoor cats, but health risks remain. Insurance is a smart investment."

      "question": "Are Ragdolls prone to heart disease?",
      "answer": "Yes. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is more common in Ragdolls than many breeds. Regular cardiac screening is recommended, especially from reputable breeders who test their cats."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Ragdolls get bladder stones?",
      "answer": "Ragdolls are predisposed to calcium oxalate bladder stones. Diet, hydration, and genetics all play roles. Stones can require surgical removal costing $1,500-4,000+."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Ragdolls have weight problems?",
      "answer": "Their laid-back nature means less activity, making them prone to obesity. Overweight cats face diabetes, joint issues, and other problems. Monitoring diet and encouraging play helps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Ragdolls expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Moderate—similar to other large breeds. Expect $26-52/month for good coverage. Their health risks justify the investment in comprehensive insurance."
