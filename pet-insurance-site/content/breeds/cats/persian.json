      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Persian cat?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Persians are one of the highest-risk breeds due to PKD, breathing issues, and eye problems. Most Persians will need ongoing veterinary care, making insurance a smart investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PKD in Persian cats?",
      "answer": "Polycystic Kidney Disease causes cysts to form in the kidneys. It's hereditary and affects up to 40% of Persians. There's no cure, but early detection and management can extend quality of life. Insurance helps cover ongoing monitoring and treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do all insurance companies cover Persian cats?",
      "answer": "Most do, but some have restrictions on brachycephalic (flat-faced) breeds. Always confirm hereditary conditions and breathing issues are covered before purchasing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Persian cats expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Slightly higher than average due to their health risks, but not the most expensive. Expect to pay $25-50/month for good coverage. The cost is justified given their likelihood of health issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get a wellness plan for my Persian?",
      "answer": "Consider it. Persians benefit from regular dental cleanings (due to overcrowded teeth) and eye exams. A wellness plan can help offset these routine costs."
