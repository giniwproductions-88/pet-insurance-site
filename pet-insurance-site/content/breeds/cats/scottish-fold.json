      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Scottish Fold?",
      "answer": "It's essential. ALL Scottish Folds have osteochondrodysplasia to some degree—it's caused by the same gene that folds their ears. This means guaranteed joint problems and chronic pain management. Insurance isn't optional for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is osteochondrodysplasia?",
      "answer": "It's a genetic disorder affecting cartilage and bone development throughout the body—not just the ears. It causes arthritis, stiff tail, stiff limbs, and chronic pain. Severity varies, but all folded-ear Scottish Folds are affected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do insurance companies exclude Scottish Folds?",
      "answer": "Some do, or exclude fold-related conditions specifically. Always verify that osteochondrodysplasia, arthritis, and joint conditions are covered BEFORE purchasing. Get it in writing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are straight-eared Scottish Folds healthier?",
      "answer": "Yes. Scottish Straights (non-folded ears) don't have the cartilage gene defect and avoid osteochondrodysplasia. They still may have HCM risk but are significantly healthier overall."
    },
    {
      "question": "When do Scottish Fold health problems start?",
      "answer": "Symptoms can appear as early as 7 weeks but often become noticeable between 6 months and 2 years. Early signs include stiff movement, reluctance to jump, and a thick, inflexible tail."
