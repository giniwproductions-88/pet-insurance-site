      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Siamese cat?",

    {
      "question": "What is amyloidosis in Siamese cats?",
      "answer": "Amyloidosis occurs when abnormal proteins deposit in organs, usually liver or kidneys. It's more common in Siamese and related breeds. There's no cure, but early detection and management can extend quality of life."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Siamese cats have respiratory problems?",
      "answer": "Many Siamese develop asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and labored breathing. Treatment typically involves inhalers or medication—costs that add up over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Siamese cats have dental problems?",
      "answer": "Siamese are prone to periodontal disease and may need more frequent dental cleanings than other breeds. Severe cases require extractions. Good dental coverage is valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Siamese cats generally healthy?",
      "answer": "Compared to many purebreds, yes. They typically live 12-20 years. However, breed-specific risks like amyloidosis and asthma mean insurance is still worthwhile."
