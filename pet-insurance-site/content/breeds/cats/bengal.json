      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Bengal cat?",
      "answer": "Yes. Bengals are prone to HCM, PRA, and joint problems—all expensive to treat. Their high activity level also means more accident risk. Insurance is a smart investment for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Bengals considered exotic for insurance purposes?",
      "answer": "Most insurers treat Bengals as domestic cats since they're several generations removed from wild ancestors. However, some may have restrictions. Always confirm before purchasing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PRA in Bengal cats?",
      "answer": "Progressive Retinal Atrophy is a genetic condition causing gradual vision loss, eventually leading to blindness. There's no cure, but affected cats adapt well. Genetic testing can identify carriers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Bengal cats get injured more often?",
      "answer": "Their athletic nature means more climbing, jumping, and exploring—which can lead to falls, sprains, or other injuries. Good accident coverage is particularly valuable for Bengals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get my Bengal tested for genetic conditions?",
      "answer": "Yes. Tests exist for PRA-b (Bengal-specific PRA) and can identify carriers. Reputable breeders screen for this. HCM requires echocardiograms for detection."
