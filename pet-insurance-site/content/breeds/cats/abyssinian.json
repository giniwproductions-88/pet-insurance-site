    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for an Abyssinian cat?",
      "answer": "Yes. Abyssinians are prone to chronic dental disease, PRA (blindness), and kidney problems. Their active nature also increases accident risk. Insurance is a smart investment for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Abyssinians have dental problems?",
      "answer": "Abyssinians are genetically predisposed to gingivitis and periodontal disease. Many need professional cleanings 1-2 times yearly and may require extractions. Dental costs add up quickly without insurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PRA in Abyssinian cats?",
      "answer": "Progressive Retinal Atrophy causes gradual vision loss, eventually leading to blindness. There's no cure, but genetic testing can identify carriers. Affected cats adapt well to vision loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Abyssinians get injured more often?",
      "answer": "Their curious, active nature means more climbing, jumping, and exploring—leading to more accidents. They're also known for getting into things. Good accident coverage is valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do Abyssinians live?",
      "answer": "Typically 12-15 years with proper care. Regular dental care, genetic screening, and keeping them safely active helps maximize lifespan."
