    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Sphynx cat?",
      "answer": "Yes. Sphynx cats are prone to HCM (very common in the breed), chronic skin issues, and dental disease. Their unique needs mean higher vet bills than average cats. Insurance is a smart investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Sphynx cats have a lot of health problems?",
      "answer": "They have specific health challenges rather than overall poor health. HCM is the biggest concern, affecting a significant percentage of Sphynx. Skin care is ongoing but manageable. With proper care, they live 12-15 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Sphynx cats need special skin care?",
      "answer": "Without fur to absorb oils, Sphynx cats develop oily skin that needs regular cleaning. They're also prone to skin infections, sunburn, and temperature-related issues. Insurance helps when skin problems need veterinary treatment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are Sphynx cats more expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "Slightly higher than average due to HCM prevalence and skin issues. Expect $28-55/month for good coverage. Some insurers may have breed restrictions—always verify before purchasing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Sphynx?",
      "answer": "Consider it. Sphynx cats benefit from regular dental cleanings and skin checks. A wellness plan can help offset routine care costs, though compare prices—sometimes paying out of pocket is cheaper."
