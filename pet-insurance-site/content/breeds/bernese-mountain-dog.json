  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Bernese Mountain Dogs have such a short lifespan?",
      "answer": "Cancer, particularly histiocytic sarcoma, affects Berners at alarming rates. Nearly 50% die from cancer, often before age 8. This genetic predisposition significantly shortens their lifespan compared to other large breeds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Bernese Mountain Dog?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. With cancer rates near 50% and high orthopedic issues, most Berners will face major medical expenses. A single cancer treatment can exceed $15,000. Insurance is mandatory for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What annual limit do I need?",
      "answer": "We recommend unlimited coverage. Cancer treatment plus joint surgery could easily exceed $20,000 in a single year. Policies with $10,000 annual limits are inadequate for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I insure my Berner?",
      "answer": "Immediately as a puppy. Joint issues can develop during rapid growth (4-12 months), and cancer can strike at any age. Early insurance ensures maximum coverage for this high-risk breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I consider a prophylactic gastropexy?",
      "answer": "Yes, strongly consider having your Berner's stomach tacked during spay/neuter surgery. This prevents bloat, which is life-threatening and expensive to treat. Some insurance covers this preventive procedure."
