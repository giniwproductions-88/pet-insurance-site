  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is Great Dane insurance so expensive?",
      "answer": "Great Danes have extremely high rates of serious conditions—bloat, heart disease, cancer, and joint problems. Their large size also means higher surgery costs. Insurance reflects these elevated risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is bloat and why is it dangerous?",
      "answer": "Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) is when the stomach fills with gas and twists. It's fatal within hours without surgery. Great Danes have the highest bloat rate of any breed—insurance is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Great Dane?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. The question isn't if your Great Dane will have major medical expenses, but when. Bloat surgery alone is $7,500+, and most Danes face multiple serious health issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I consider a prophylactic gastropexy?",
      "answer": "A gastropexy (stomach tacking) can prevent bloat and is often done during spay/neuter. It costs $200-500 when combined with another surgery. Some insurance plans cover this preventive procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What annual limit do I need for a Great Dane?",
      "answer": "We recommend unlimited coverage or at least $20,000+ annually. A single bloat surgery plus heart disease treatment could easily exceed $15,000 in one year."
