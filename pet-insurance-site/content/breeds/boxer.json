    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Boxer?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Boxers have one of the highest rates of serious illness among dog breeds. Between cancer, heart disease, and other issues, most Boxer owners will face significant vet bills. Insurance is highly recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I look for in Boxer insurance?",
      "answer": "Prioritize cancer coverage with high or no limits, heart condition coverage, and emergency surgery coverage for bloat. Avoid policies with low annual limits or cancer-specific caps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do insurance companies charge more for Boxers?",
      "answer": "Yes, Boxers typically have higher premiums than many breeds due to their elevated health risks. Expect to pay $50-85/month for comprehensive coverage. It's worth it given their health profile."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get my Boxer insured as a puppy?",
      "answer": "Definitely. Insuring early ensures heart conditions and other issues won't be considered pre-existing. Many Boxer health problems don't appear until age 5-8, so early coverage is crucial."
