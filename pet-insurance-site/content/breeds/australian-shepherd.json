    {
      "question": "What is the MDR1 gene mutation?",
      "answer": "Many Australian Shepherds carry a gene mutation making them sensitive to certain medications, including some sedatives and anti-parasitic drugs. Test your Aussie and inform your vet—it affects treatment options but not insurance coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for an Australian Shepherd?",
      "answer": "Yes. Aussies are prone to hip dysplasia ($7,000+ for surgery), eye problems, and epilepsy. Their active lifestyle also means more accident risk. Insurance helps manage these costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do Australian Shepherds have a lot of health problems?",
      "answer": "Aussies have moderate health concerns—better than many breeds but not problem-free. Main issues are joint problems, eye conditions, and epilepsy. Responsible breeding and early insurance help manage risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Aussie?",
      "answer": "Optional. Active Aussies may benefit from wellness plans covering routine care and annual eye exams. However, compare costs—paying out of pocket sometimes saves money."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are sports injuries covered by insurance?",
      "answer": "Yes, most pet insurance covers accidents including sports injuries from agility, frisbee, or herding activities. Aussies are athletic and active, making accident coverage particularly valuable."
