    {
      "question": "Are Yorkies expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "No, Yorkshire Terriers are among the cheapest breeds to insure—typically $30-55/month. Their small size means lower surgery costs, though dental and knee issues can still be expensive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Yorkies have so many dental problems?",
      "answer": "Their tiny jaws can't accommodate all their teeth properly, leading to severe crowding, decay, and gum disease. Many Yorkies need teeth extracted. Look for insurance covering dental illness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Yorkie?",
      "answer": "Yes, particularly for knee problems and potential liver issues. Surgery for a liver shunt can cost $10,000+. Even dental disease adds up over their long lifespan."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is luxating patella?",
      "answer": "A condition where the kneecap slides out of place, common in toy breeds like Yorkies. It causes pain and lameness, often requiring surgery at $1,500-$3,500 per knee."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Yorkie?",
      "answer": "Wellness coverage can be worthwhile since Yorkies need regular dental cleanings. However, do the math—sometimes paying out of pocket costs less than wellness plan premiums."
