    {
      "question": "Are Yorkies expensive to insure?",
      "answer": "No, Yorkshire Terriers are actually less expensive to insure than larger breeds—typically $30-55/month. Their small size means lower surgery costs, though vet bills can still be significant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Yorkies have so many dental problems?",
      "answer": "Their tiny jaws cause severe teeth crowding, making them prone to decay, gum disease, and tooth loss. Many Yorkies need dental extractions by middle age. Look for insurance that covers dental illness (not just accidents)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Yorkie?",
      "answer": "Yes, particularly because of knee problems (luxating patella) and potential liver issues. Surgery for a liver shunt can cost $10,000+. Even dental disease adds up over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is luxating patella?",
      "answer": "A condition where the kneecap slides out of place, common in toy breeds like Yorkies. It can cause pain and lameness, often requiring surgery at $1,500-$3,500 per knee."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get wellness coverage for my Yorkie?",
      "answer": "Wellness coverage can be worthwhile for Yorkies since they need regular dental cleanings. However, do the math—sometimes paying out of pocket for cleanings costs less than a wellness plan premium."
