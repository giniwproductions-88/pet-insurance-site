  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do all insurance companies cover Rottweilers?",
      "answer": "Most pet insurance companies cover Rottweilers, but some homeowner's insurance policies have breed restrictions that can complicate things. For pet insurance specifically, major providers like Healthy Paws, Embrace, and Trupanion all cover Rottweilers without issue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is cancer coverage important for Rottweilers?",
      "answer": "Rottweilers have one of the highest cancer rates of any breed, particularly bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Treatment can easily exceed $10,000, making comprehensive cancer coverage essential. Look for policies with no cancer-specific limits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best age to insure a Rottweiler?",
      "answer": "Insure your Rottweiler as a puppy, ideally around 8-12 weeks. Cancer and joint issues often develop in middle age (5-8 years), so having coverage established early ensures these won't be considered pre-existing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I get coverage for hip dysplasia?",
      "answer": "Yes, orthopedic coverage is crucial for Rottweilers. Hip dysplasia surgery can cost $7,000+, and many Rottweilers need it. Be aware of waiting periods—some insurers require 12 months before covering hip issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Rottweiler?",
      "answer": "Yes. Given their elevated cancer risk and likelihood of orthopedic issues, most Rottweiler owners will face at least one major medical expense. Insurance provides peace of mind and makes expensive treatments financially accessible."
