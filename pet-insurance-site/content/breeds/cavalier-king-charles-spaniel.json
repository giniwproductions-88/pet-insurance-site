  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Cavaliers have so many heart problems?",
      "answer": "Cavaliers have a genetic predisposition to Mitral Valve Disease (MVD). Studies show virtually all Cavaliers develop heart murmurs by age 10, with many showing signs much earlier. It's the leading cause of death in the breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is syringomyelia?",
      "answer": "Syringomyelia is a condition where the skull is too small for the brain, forcing spinal fluid into the spinal cord. It causes severe pain, scratching at the air, and neurological symptoms. Up to 70% of Cavaliers have it to some degree."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is pet insurance worth it for a Cavalier?",
      "answer": "Absolutely essential. Cavaliers have the highest rates of serious illness among small breeds. Heart treatment can cost $20,000+, and syringomyelia may require MRI ($2,000) and surgery. Insurance is mandatory for this breed."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I insure my Cavalier?",
      "answer": "Immediately as a puppy—this is crucial. Heart murmurs and SM symptoms can appear as early as age 1-2. Once documented, they become pre-existing conditions. Early insurance is essential."
    },
    {
      "question": "What annual limit do I need for a Cavalier?",
      "answer": "We recommend unlimited coverage or at least $15,000+ annually. Heart disease and syringomyelia are expensive, ongoing conditions. Low limits will be exhausted quickly."
