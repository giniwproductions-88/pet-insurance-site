              <p className="text-gray-700">
                French Bulldogs are one of the few breeds where insurance is almost universally worth it. Their health problems aren't possibilities—they're probabilities. The math strongly favors insurance.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why French Bulldogs Are Different</h2>
            <p>
              For most breeds, pet insurance is a hedge against bad luck. For French Bulldogs, it's a hedge against near-certainties.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed's structure creates predictable problems:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Flat face</strong> → Breathing issues (BOAS) in 50%+ of Frenchies</li>
              <li><strong>Compact spine</strong> → Back problems (IVDD) common</li>
              <li><strong>Skin folds</strong> → Chronic infections and allergies</li>
              <li><strong>Narrow hips</strong> → Hip dysplasia risk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These aren't rare conditions. They're breed characteristics. Most Frenchie owners will deal with at least one major health issue.
            </p>

            <h2>The Math: Insurance vs. Paying Out of Pocket</h2>

            <h3>What You'll Pay for Insurance</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 my-4 not-prose">
              <ul className="space-y-1">
                <li>Monthly premium: <strong>$45 - $85</strong></li>
                <li>Annual cost: <strong>$540 - $1,020</strong></li>
                <li>Over 10 years: <strong>$5,400 - $10,200</strong></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>What You Might Pay Without Insurance</h3>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-4 my-4 not-prose">
              <ul className="space-y-1">
                <li>BOAS surgery: <strong>$2,000 - $5,000</strong></li>
                <li>IVDD surgery: <strong>$3,000 - $9,000</strong></li>
                <li>Allergy management (lifetime): <strong>$10,000 - $25,000</strong></li>
                <li>Hip dysplasia treatment: <strong>$500 - $7,000</strong></li>
                <li>Cherry eye surgery: <strong>$500 - $1,500</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-4 font-semibold">Potential total: $15,000 - $45,000+</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              Let's say you pay $70/month ($8,400 over 10 years) and your Frenchie needs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>BOAS surgery: $3,500</li>
              <li>Chronic allergies (10 years): $15,000</li>
              <li>One IVDD episode: $4,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Total vet bills: $22,500</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              With 80% reimbursement and a $500 deductible:
            </p>
            <p>
              Insurance pays: ~$17,600<br />
              You pay: ~$4,900 + $8,400 (premiums) = <strong>$13,300</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Savings: ~$9,200</strong>
            </p>

            <div className="bg-brand-50 border border-brand-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-6 not-prose">
              <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Key Insight</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                You don't need catastrophic luck for insurance to pay off with a Frenchie. Routine breed issues alone often exceed what you'll pay in premiums.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>When Insurance Might NOT Be Worth It</h2>
            <p>
              To be fair, there are scenarios where you might not come out ahead:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Unusually healthy Frenchie</strong> — Rare, but some get lucky</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-existing conditions</strong> — If your Frenchie already has issues, they won't be covered</li>
              <li><strong>Very high deductible chosen</strong> — Reduces premiums but also reduces benefit</li>
              <li><strong>You can comfortably pay $10,000+ unexpected bills</strong> — Self-insuring is an option if you have savings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              But statistically? Most Frenchie owners will file claims that exceed their premiums.
            </p>

            <h2>What You Need in a Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Not all insurance is equal for French Bulldogs. Make sure yours covers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>✓ BOAS and respiratory conditions</li>
              <li>✓ IVDD and spinal issues (short waiting period preferred)</li>
              <li>✓ Chronic conditions like allergies</li>
              <li>✓ Hip dysplasia (watch the waiting period)</li>
              <li>✓ Hereditary and congenital conditions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Red Flags to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>✗ Brachycephalic breed exclusions</li>
              <li>✗ 12+ month orthopedic waiting periods</li>
              <li>✗ Low annual limits (under $10,000)</li>
              <li>✗ Per-condition caps</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Get Insurance</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>As early as possible.</strong> French Bulldog puppies can show BOAS symptoms within months. Once a condition is documented, it's pre-existing and excluded.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideal timing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>8-12 weeks old (when you get the puppy)</li>
              <li>Before first vet visit documents any issues</li>
              <li>During breeder's health guarantee window</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Verdict</h2>
            <p>
              For French Bulldogs specifically, pet insurance is one of the clearest "yes" decisions in the pet world. The breed's structural health issues make significant vet bills highly likely—not just possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only question is which policy, not whether to get one.
